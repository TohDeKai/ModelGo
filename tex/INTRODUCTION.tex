%实际上，license analysis应该可分为四层，最底层是license 是否 compliance (或者叫做dataset provenance extraction, License identification)，例如数据集的license是否可以覆盖每个sample，还有就是distribution的版本的license和official source的license不一致，第二层是license之间是否conflict，第三层是应用所需的rights是否具备，最顶层是应用场景是否符合法律法规（regulation）


Software reuse is very simple from the legal point of view, if a company or an
individual reuses software for which it has copyrights. However, things change dramatically
if one wants to reuse software made by others, since software is protected
by copyright and possibly by patents. Without explicit permission, no person other
than the copyright holder is allowed to copy, distribute, or make derivative works
from the original work.
