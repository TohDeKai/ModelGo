## Diff View of ModelGo Licenses

If you are familiar with the [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/), it will not be a tricky task to understand the meanings of licensing options in ModelGo, which follow the same philosophy to make licensing flexible and easy-to-use.

To enhance understanding and increase transparency of ModelGo licenses, we offer a diff view:

## Licensing Tips

* Choose the options that most closely match your publishing needs.
* Choose revocable licenses if you haven't finalized your decision yet.
* Do not choose RAI licenses if your project contains any GPL or LGPL components.
* If your project already contains any components under MG licenses with an OS option, you must license your entire project with the same OS option.
