## Overview

ModelGo is a a specialized parser designed for license analysis in **Mahine Learning Project**. It mainly provides three features currently:

The struct of ModelGo:

```

## How to Use

For the use cases demonstrated in the paper, you can run the corresponding code in main.py to observe the analysis results. For a new use case, you should define your `Work` variable and `license` variable (if the used license is not in `licenses_description.yml`, you also need to update this file) model-reusing workflow, similar to what is done in `main.py`.

## Why We Need ModelGo ðŸ¤”

![motivation](.gitbook/assets/motivations.png)

In a ML project, there are typically three main components: data, code, and model. Each of these components is governed by distinct licenses. For instance, an article from arXiv might be licensed under CC BY-NC-SA, while content from Wikipedia could be under CC BY-SA. Similarly, the modeling code and the model itself may have different licenses. **Therefore, traditional OSS license analysis, which only considers code dependency, will fail in the ML project situation**.

## Unique Challenges in License Analysis for ML Projects ðŸ˜¥

![challenges](.gitbook/assets/challenges.png)

There are three challenges we need consider when we design ModelGo:

1. ML projects may involve multiple types of licenses. For instance, the modeling code may be licensed as software, while the training dataset may be governed under content or database licensing frameworks like Creative Commons. Particularly challenging are the newly introduced responsible AI licenses such as OpenRAIL and Llama2, which are not supported by traditional license analysis applications. Addressing multiple licensing frameworks in a single license analysis application poses a significant challenge.
2. ML workflows can be nested, involving multiple rounds of reuse. For instance, we may fine-tune a pretrained model with additional data and then distill the tuned model using another set of data. This intricate reuse flowchart establishes a complex dependency relationship among ML components, presenting a unique challenge for license analysis.
3. The prevalence of improper licensing in current ML projects. Due to a lack of consensus in licensing, many models opt for software licenses or content licenses that simply match their code or dataset, which is not suitable for the ML scenario. It becomes challenging to find matching terms for ML activities such as training and distillation. Additionally, many ML projects do not declare license information, further increasing the ambiguity for license analysis.
